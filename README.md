# Firebase Integration with Flutter

## 📌 Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we explore **Firebase**, Google’s powerful **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** platform, and integrate it with a **Flutter** application. Firebase enables developers to build scalable, real-time mobile applications without managing servers.

This project demonstrates how Firebase handles:

* 🔐 Authentication
* ☁️ Cloud Firestore (real-time database)
* 📦 Cloud Storage

By the end of this assignment, the Flutter app is connected to Firebase, supports real-time data synchronization, and persists user sessions across devices.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how Firebase enables **authentication**, **database**, and **cloud storage** integration in mobile apps, and how **Cloud Firestore maintains real-time data synchronization** between users and devices.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Flutter (Dart)
* Firebase

  * Firebase Core
  * Firebase Authentication
  * Cloud Firestore
  * Firebase Storage (optional)
* FlutterFire CLI

---

## 🚀 Firebase Setup for Flutter App (Flutter Selected in Firebase Console)

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project was created by selecting **Flutter** as the app type in the Firebase Console.
> Because of this, Firebase configuration is handled using the **FlutterFire CLI**, not by manually adding platform apps one by one.

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to **Firebase Console**
2. Click **Add Project**
3. Enter project name
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional)

### Step 2: Add Flutter App to Firebase

1. In Firebase Console, click **Add App**
2. Select **Flutter** (not Android or iOS individually)
3. Firebase shows platform icons (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, etc.)
4. Firebase expects configuration via **FlutterFire CLI**

📌 **No manual download of `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` is required** when using FlutterFire CLI.

* Choose **Android / iOS / Web**
* Register app
* Download configuration file:

  * Android → `google-services.json`
  * iOS → `GoogleService-Info.plist`
* Place the file in the correct platform folder

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Add the following to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^3.0.0
  firebase_auth: ^5.0.0
  cloud_firestore: ^5.0.0
  firebase_storage: ^12.0.0
```

Run:

```
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Configure Firebase with FlutterFire CLI

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

This generates `firebase_options.dart` automatically.

---

## 🔧 Firebase Initialization (FlutterFire-based)

Because Flutter was selected in Firebase Console, Firebase must be initialized using `firebase_options.dart` generated by FlutterFire CLI.

Update `main.dart` as follows:

Initialize Firebase inside `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

This ensures Firebase is ready before the app starts.

## 🔑 Key Firebase Services Explained

| Service                 | Purpose                                | Example Use Case      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Firebase Authentication | Manages user sign-up, login & sessions | Email/Password login  |
| Cloud Firestore         | Real-time NoSQL database               | Chat apps, task lists |
| Firebase Storage        | Stores media files                     | Profile pictures      |
| Cloud Functions         | Serverless backend logic               | Notifications, emails |

---

## 🔐 Firebase Authentication Implementation

Firebase Authentication simplifies secure login and session handling.

### Example Code:

```dart
Future<void> signUp(String email, String password) async {
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: email,
    password: password,
  );
}

Future<void> signIn(String email, String password) async {
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: email,
    password: password,
  );
}
```

✔ Handles authentication securely
✔ Automatically manages user sessions

---

## 🔥 Firestore Real-Time Data Integration

Firestore syncs data **automatically and in real time** across all connected devices.

### Firestore Collection Example:

```dart
final CollectionReference tasks =
    FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('tasks');

Future<void> addTask(String title) {
  return tasks.add({
    'title': title,
    'createdAt': Timestamp.now(),
  });
}

Stream<QuerySnapshot> getTasks() {
  return tasks.orderBy('createdAt', descending: true).snapshots();
}
```

### UI with Real-Time Updates:

```dart
StreamBuilder(
  stream: getTasks(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (!snapshot.hasData) return CircularProgressIndicator();
    final docs = snapshot.data!.docs;
    return ListView(
      children: docs.map((doc) => Text(doc['title'])).toList(),
    );
  },
);
```

📌 When one user adds data, all users see it instantly without refresh.

---

## 📦 Firebase Storage (Optional)

Used for uploading and retrieving files like images.

```dart
Future<void> uploadFile(File imageFile) async {
  final ref = FirebaseStorage.instance.ref('uploads/image.jpg');
  await ref.putFile(imageFile);
}
```

Files are securely stored and accessible via download URLs.

---

## 🧪 Testing Real-Time Sync

* Run app on **two devices/emulators**
* Add/update Firestore data
* Observe instant UI updates on both devices
* Monitor live changes in Firebase Console → Firestore → Data tab

## 🧾 Dedicated Section: Commands & Solutions Reference (Flutter-Specific)

This section contains all commands used and all issues faced during **Flutter + Firebase setup**, along with their solutions, kept for future reference.

### 🔹 Common Commands Used

```bash
flutter doctor
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter run
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

---

### 🔹 Common Problems & Solutions

#### ❌ Firebase CLI not recognized

✅ Add to PATH:

```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin
```

---

#### ❌ A dependency may only have one source

✅ Fix `pubspec.yaml` structure:

* Keep `firebase_core` in `dependencies`
* Keep `flutter_test` in `dev_dependencies`

---

#### ❌ Building with plugins requires symlink support (Windows)

✅ Enable Developer Mode:

```
start ms-settings:developers
```

Then toggle **Developer Mode ON**
